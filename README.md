# Ventora AI  
**A Privacy-First Personal Health Companion**

Ventora AI is a personal health companion designed to help people **organize, reflect on, and manage their health-related information** in one private and secure place.  
It focuses on **education, awareness, and personal organization** — not medical diagnosis or treatment.

This project was built as part of a hands-on learning journey into AI systems, responsible design, and privacy-first architecture.

  Ventora AI supports organization and understanding, not decision-making.

- **Learning by building**  
  Real-world system design is prioritized over theory.
